**Project Title:**

Doctor Profile Analysis Using IBM SPSS Modeler

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing doctor-related data using IBM SPSS Modeler to uncover valuable statistical insights. The goal is to understand how factors like demographics, years of experience, specialization, and hospital distribution influence the overall healthcare landscape. Using SPSS, descriptive and predictive analytics are applied to interpret the dataset effectively.

**Objective:**

Manual data interpretation in the healthcare sector can often be inconsistent and time-consuming. This project aims to provide a data-driven analytical approach to evaluate doctor profiles and identify meaningful trends. The insights derived can help hospitals, researchers, and policymakers make informed decisions regarding workforce distribution and experience patterns.

**Dataset Details:**

The dataset contains information about doctors, including their demographics and professional background. It consists of multiple records, each representing an individual doctor with the following attributes:

Doctor ID

Gender

Age

Specialization

Years of Experience

Hospital Name

Location

Patient Count

Rating

**Tools Used:**

IBM SPSS Modeler

Data Preparation Nodes (Select, Type, Filter)

Descriptive Statistics Node

Graphs & Visualization Nodes

GitHub for version control and project submission

**Process Summary:**

Imported the dataset into IBM SPSS Modeler.

Cleaned and formatted missing or inconsistent values.

Defined key variables for analysis such as Years of Experience and Specialization.

Performed Descriptive Analysis to understand patterns in the dataset.

Used Graphs and Tables to visualize distributions and relationships.

Derived insights and exported results for reporting.

**Model Results / Key Insights:**

Most doctors with more than 10 years of experience are concentrated in urban hospitals.

Specialization and experience are key indicators of higher patient counts.

Female doctors showed a higher representation in pediatric and general medicine fields.

The analysis provided clear patterns that can assist in resource allocation and workforce planning in hospitals.

**Future Improvements:**

Apply Decision Tree or K-Means Clustering for deeper insights.

Add more attributes like patient satisfaction scores for better analysis.

Compare results using different statistical models.

Integrate findings into an interactive dashboard for visualization.
